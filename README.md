this is a deepfake mini project.

for now we worked on images, processed them and applied simple algorithm like logistic regression and random forest and also algorithm like  cnn network
next  we will train the model on videos to make it detect for both images and videos.This project is focused on detecting deepfakes. So far, we have worked with images, applied preprocessing techniques, and used  algorithms such as logistic regression , random forest and CNN for initial analysis.

ongoing Plans:

Extend the model to be trained on videos, enabling it to detect deepfakes in both images and videos.
