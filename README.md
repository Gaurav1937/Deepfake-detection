this is a deepfake mini project.

for now we worked on images, processed them and applied simple algorithm like logistic regression and random forest and also algorithm like  cnn network
next  we will train the model on videos to make it detect for both images and videos.This project is focused on detecting deepfakes. So far, we have worked with images, applied preprocessing techniques, and used  algorithms such as logistic regression , random forest and CNN for initial analysis.
Along with this
The df_final file Utilizes the Xception model, a deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet, for detecting deepfake images.
The Xception model is highly effective for image classification tasks due to its depthwise separable convolutions, making it efficient and accurate for identifying real vs. fake images in the dataset.

ongoing Plans:

Extend the model to be trained on videos, enabling it to detect deepfakes in both images and videos.
