this is a deepfake mini project.
for now we worked on images, processed them and applied simple algorithm like logistic regression and random forest.
next we will apply cnn, and after that we will train the model on videos to make it detect for both images and videos.This project is focused on detecting deepfakes. So far, we have worked with images, applied preprocessing techniques, and used simple algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest for initial analysis.

ongoing Plans:
Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection accuracy.
then
Extend the model to be trained on videos, enabling it to detect deepfakes in both images and videos.
